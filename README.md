# Protein Tracker App

An AI-powered nutrition tracking application that helps you monitor your protein intake using image recognition and manual food entry. **Optimized for 100+ active users and hundreds of meal posts.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/login.html` (or your server's host). The frontend auto-detects the API base via `window.location.origin` so it works on any IP or hostname.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### High-Scale Architecture
- **100+ Concurrent Users**: Optimized database connections and connection pooling
- **Hundreds of Meal Posts**: Efficient pagination and caching system
- **Fast Response Times**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **Scalable Database**: Optimized SQLite with proper indexing

### Key Optimizations
- **Database Connection Pooling**: 20 connections with 30 overflow capacity
- **In-Memory Caching**: LRU cache with TTL for dashboard data
- **Pagination**: Configurable page sizes (1-100 items per page)
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries on user_id and created_at
- **Background Tasks**: Automatic cache cleanup and meal cleanup
- **Today's Meals**: Shows ALL meals for the day, not just 6 most recent

### Performance Testing
Run the optimization test suite:
```bash
python test_optimization.py
```

This tests concurrent users, caching performance, and pagination functionality.

## üîß Configuration

### Email Verification Setup (Optional)
To enable email verification for new accounts:

```bash
python setup_env.py
```

Follow the prompts to configure Gmail SMTP settings.

**Note:** If email verification is not configured, new accounts will be automatically verified and users can log in immediately.

### Google Cloud Vision API (Required for Food Detection)
For multi-item AI-powered food detection, you need a Google Cloud Vision API service account:

1. **Create a service account** in Google Cloud Console
2. **Download the JSON key file** and save it as `service-account-key.json` in the project directory
3. **Enable the Vision API** in your Google Cloud project

The app uses improved confidence thresholds and can detect multiple food items in complex meals like English breakfast.

Set `APP_BASE_URL` in your environment if you need email links to point to a public hostname (used in verification emails):

```
APP_BASE_URL=https://your.domain:8000
```

**Note:** Google Vision API with service account is required for food detection. The app uses improved confidence thresholds (0.70) to detect multiple food items in complex meals.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Account Creation Issues

If you encounter problems creating accounts:

1. **JavaScript Error:** The form reset error has been fixed. Try refreshing the page.

2. **Email Verification:** 
   - If email verification is not configured, accounts are automatically verified
   - If you need to manually verify an existing account, run:
     ```bash
     python cleanup.py
     ```
   - Select option 2 to manually verify users

3. **"Account Already Exists" Error:**
   - This happens when the first registration attempt creates the account but fails to send verification email
   - Use the cleanup script to verify the existing account or reset the password

### Manual Account Management

The `cleanup.py` script provides several utilities:

- **List all users** - See all registered users and their verification status
- **Manually verify users** - Verify accounts that couldn't receive email verification
- **Reset passwords** - Reset user passwords if needed
- **Clean up old meals** - Remove old meal data and images

## üìß Email Verification

The app supports email verification for enhanced security:

- **Configured:** Users receive verification emails and must verify before logging in
- **Not Configured:** Accounts are automatically verified for immediate access

To check email verification status, visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/email-status` (adjust host as needed)

## üçΩÔ∏è Features

## üß™ Testing

### Performance Testing
```bash
python test_optimization.py
```

### Profile Picture Testing
```bash
python test_profile_picture.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Register multiple users
2. Upload many meals per user (including complex meals like English breakfast)
3. Test pagination in "All Meals" view
4. Verify "Today's Meals" shows all meals for the day
5. Test dashboard performance with cached data
6. Test multi-item food detection with complex meals

### Multi-Item Detection Testing
```bash
python test_multi_item_detection.py
```

This tests the improved detection system that can handle complex meals with multiple food items.

### Protein Calculation Testing
```bash
python test_protein_calculation.py
```

This tests the improved protein calculation system that provides accurate readings for multi-item meals.

### Over-Detection Fix Testing
```bash
python test_over_detection_fix.py
```

This tests the improved detection logic to ensure it doesn't over-detect multiple items when there's only one item in the image (e.g., beef only should not detect chicken, tea, roast beef, etc.).
