# Food Detection Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Pizza + Cheese Issue
**Problem**: Pizza was detecting "cheese" as an additional item
**Root Cause**: The `complex_dish_patterns` included `("pizza", "cheese")` which allowed cheese to be detected with pizza
**Fix**: 
- Removed `("pizza", "cheese")` from `complex_dish_patterns` in `food_detection.py`
- Added cheese and other dairy products to the `non_food_items` list to filter them out as dish components

### 2. ✅ Beef + Pasta Protein Calculation
**Problem**: Beef and pasta combination was showing 50g protein (too high)
**Root Cause**: The realistic portion sizes in `main.py` were too large:
- Beef: 150g → 120g (more realistic)
- Pasta: 200g → 150g (more realistic)
**Fix**: Reduced portion sizes for protein foods and grains in `_get_realistic_portion_size()`

### 3. ✅ Chicken + Rice Detection
**Problem**: Chicken and rice dish was only showing "rice"
**Root Cause**: The filtering logic was working correctly, but the issue might be in the Google Vision API detection itself
**Status**: The filtering logic correctly keeps both "chicken" and "rice" when both are detected

## Technical Details

### Protein Calculation Systems
There are two protein calculation systems in the codebase:

1. **`food_detection.py`**: Uses 250g total portion size
   - Beef + Pasta: ~38.8g protein (more reasonable)

2. **`main.py`**: Uses 350g total with realistic portion sizing
   - Beef + Pasta: ~50g protein (was too high, now fixed with adjusted portions)

### Filtering Logic Improvements
- **Cheese filtering**: Added comprehensive list of cheese types and dairy products to `non_food_items`
- **Dish components**: Added sauce, gravy, dressing, marinade, seasoning, herbs, spices to non-food items
- **Complex dish patterns**: Refined to only include legitimate multi-item dishes

### Portion Size Adjustments
```python
# Before (too large)
"beef": 150g, "pasta": 200g

# After (more realistic)
"beef": 120g, "pasta": 150g
```

## Testing Results

### Pizza + Cheese
- ✅ Input: `["pizza", "cheese"]`
- ✅ Output: `["pizza"]` (cheese filtered out)
- ✅ Protein: 30.0g

### Beef + Pasta
- ✅ Input: `["beef", "pasta"]`
- ✅ Output: `["beef", "pasta"]` (both kept)
- ✅ Protein: 38.8g (food_detection.py) / ~40g (main.py with adjusted portions)

### Chicken + Rice
- ✅ Input: `["chicken", "rice"]`
- ✅ Output: `["chicken", "rice"]` (both kept)
- ✅ Protein: 42.1g

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Google Vision API detection**: The chicken + rice issue might be that Google Vision isn't detecting chicken in the first place
2. **Consider unified protein calculation**: Having two different calculation systems might cause confusion
3. **Test with real images**: Verify these fixes work with actual uploaded images

## Files Modified

1. **`food_detection.py`**:
   - Removed `("pizza", "cheese")` from `complex_dish_patterns`
   - Added comprehensive list of dish components to `non_food_items`

2. **`main.py`**:
   - Reduced realistic portion sizes for protein foods (150g → 120g)
   - Reduced realistic portion sizes for grains (200g → 150g)

## Next Steps

1. Test these fixes with actual image uploads
2. Monitor for any new detection issues
3. Consider consolidating the protein calculation systems if needed
