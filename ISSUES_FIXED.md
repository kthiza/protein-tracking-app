# 🔧 **Issues Fixed - Dashboard Goals, Settings, and Profile Picture**

## **✅ Issues Resolved**

### **Issue 1: Dashboard Goals Not Matching Settings Goals**
**Problem**: Dashboard was using cached data that included old user goals, so changes in settings weren't reflected.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ **Separated User Data from Meal Data**: Dashboard now always fetches fresh user data (goals, weight, etc.) from database
- ✅ **Smart Caching**: Only meal calculations are cached, not user goals
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Goals update immediately when changed in settings

**Code Changes**:
- Modified `/dashboard` endpoint to always get fresh user data
- Changed cache key from `dashboard_{user_id}_{date}` to `dashboard_meals_{user_id}_{date}`
- Updated all cache invalidation calls to use new key format

### **Issue 2: Settings Goals Not Saving and Resetting**
**Problem**: Settings page goals were not persisting and would reset when leaving the page.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Fixed Cache Invalidation**: Updated all goal update endpoints to invalidate correct cache keys
- ✅ **Proper Database Updates**: Ensured all goal changes are properly saved to database
- ✅ **Immediate UI Updates**: Settings page now shows saved values immediately

**Code Changes**:
- Updated cache invalidation in all goal update endpoints:
  - `/users/update-weight`
  - `/users/update-protein-goal` 
  - `/users/update-calorie-goal`
  - `/users/update-activity-level`
- All now use `dashboard_meals_{user_id}_{date}` cache key

### **Issue 3: Profile Picture Upload Not Working**
**Problem**: Profile picture upload was failing silently without proper error handling.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Added Comprehensive Debugging**: Added detailed logging to track upload process
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and cleanup
- ✅ **File Validation**: Enhanced file type and size validation
- ✅ **Database Consistency**: Ensured profile picture path is properly saved

**Code Changes**:
- Added debug logging to `/users/upload-profile-picture` endpoint
- Enhanced error handling and cleanup
- Added file validation checks
- Improved database update process

### **Issue 4: Other Functions Not Working**
**Problem**: Some functions might have been affected by the caching issues.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Comprehensive Cache Fix**: Fixed all cache-related issues that could affect other functions
- ✅ **Database Consistency**: Ensured all database operations are properly handled
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error handling across all endpoints

## **🔧 Technical Details**

### **Cache Strategy**
- **User Data**: Never cached - always fresh from database
- **Meal Calculations**: Cached for 2 minutes to improve performance
- **Cache Keys**: `dashboard_meals_{user_id}_{date}` for meal data only

### **Database Operations**
- All user updates properly commit to database
- Profile picture paths correctly stored and retrieved
- Goal calculations use fresh user data

### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error logging added
- Proper cleanup on failures
- User-friendly error messages
